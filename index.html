And giving someone a genuine compliment is one of the easiest ways to practice kindness!

			My sister H is my best friend, I love her with all my heart and would do anything she asked of me. I owe her so much. She is the strongest women I know. She is one of the nicest people I know she would do anything for anyone. But her true strength is that she doesn't suffer fools gladly. I love that about her. She says what’s one her mind and doesn't hold grudges.
